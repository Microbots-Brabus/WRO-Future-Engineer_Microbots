This repository contains a set of materials to help students and their coaches to start preparing to the WRO Future Engineers competition.

The WRO Future Engineers is the competition of the self-driven vehicles.
Students of the age group from 15 till 19 need to design a model of a car,
equip it with electromechanical components and program it as so it will be able to autonomously drive on the track avoiding objections.



in our code we used functions for each component's assignment :

the body of code :

1- definition the libraries .

2- definition the objects .

3- definition the variables .

4- definition the functions .

5- void setup . 

6-  void loop .

We used (Tof sensors - Gyro sensor - Ultra sonic sensor - Servo motor - Brushless motor )

Explain the Functions ---->

setID() {...} // set the Tof sensor

mpu_setup(){.....} //the command that wil be used in the setup 

mpu_loop() {.....}      // the command that wil be used in the loop

calibrateGyro(){....}   // some time gyro need to calibrate

P_id_gyro() {....} // apply Pid using gyro

read_tof_R1() // read value from first right tof

read_tof_R2() // read value from second right tof

read_tof_L1() // read value from first Left tof

read_tof_L2() // read value from second Left tof

read_tof_f() // read value from front tof
