This repository contains a set of materials to help students and their coaches to start preparing to the WRO Future Engineers competition.

The WRO Future Engineers is the competition of the self-driven vehicles.
Students of the age group from 15 till 19 need to design a model of a car,
equip it with electromechanical components and program it as so it will be able to autonomously drive on the track avoiding objections.



in our code we used functions for each component's assignment :

the body of code :

1- definition the libraries .

2- definition the objects .

3- definition the variables .

4- definition the functions .

5- void setup .

6-  void loop .

We used (Tof sensors - Gyro sensor - Ultra sonic sensor - Servo motor - Brushless motor )
